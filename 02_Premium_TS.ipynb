    "\n",
    "The new cash, which brings Anysphere’s total raised to $11 million, will be put toward hiring and supporting Anysphere’s AI and machine learning research, co-founder and CEO Michael Truell said\n",
    "\n",
    "“In the next several years, our mission is to make programming an order of magnitude faster, more fun and creative,” Truell told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Our platform enables all developers to build software faster.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Truell met Anysphere’s other co-founders, Sualeh Asif, Arvid Lunnemark and Aman Sanger, while at MIT, where they became close friends. The four shared the goal of creating an integrated development environment (IDE) that could speed up common programming and software building tasks, like debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, Cursor, which is a fork of VS Code, Microsoft’s open source code editor, packs AI-powered tools designed to help developers write — and ask questions about — code. Cursor can respond to queries like “What service in VS Code lets me save a state to disk,” for instance, and pull up relevant documentation and code definitions as programmers work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor also features generative AI capabilities powered by OpenAI models, namely the ability to generate code from a prompt. And it can passively scan files and surface potential bugs in codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When people think ‘AI plus coding,’ their mind usually goes to AI-powered autocomplete,” Sanger said via email. “We think this has been done particularly well by GitHub Copilot and others, so we’re focused on features that come after autocomplete, like finding and fixing bugs and codebase Q&A.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Does Cursor have much hope of competing with the incumbents in the IDE space, though? That’s a reasonable question. According to StackOverflow’s 2023 Developer Survey, Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code remains far and away the most popular IDE, with ~73% of developers saying that it’s their go-to. The Anysphere team, indeed, sees Microsoft is their main competitor. And they acknowledge that the tech giant has a substantial distribution advantage. But they make the case that, because Visual Studio Code has a wide and varied customer base, Microsoft can’t make radical changes or ship major upgrades very quickly without risking alienating a portion of its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The ceiling in the AI coding space is so high — there’s so much to do — that it’s not possible to just clone the tech and then put great sales on top,” Truell said. “You need to constantly evolve the tech. There’s over 26 million developers around the world, and there’s a huge market for those that want a truly AI-native experience.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The five-person Anysphere team is nothing if not ambitious, with a host of features they hope to get to on the development roadmap for Cursor. In the coming months, the plan is to enable Cursor to make more complex edits across files and entire folders, improve at finding code and learn new libraries from documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, Anysphere’s popularity is slowly growing, Truell claims, with tens of thousands of people on the platform and a “fast-growing” paying customer base. Annual recurring revenue is already over $1 million — an auspicious start for a roughly-one-year-old company.\n",
    "\n",
    "“For now, we’re focused on the individual and teams experience over Enterprise,” Sanger said. “In the long term, we believe Cursor will be a no-brainer for enterprises, given the massive boost in developer productivity.” \"\"\"\n",

However, he lived in a kingdom where magic was forbidden, and the king had ordered all wizards to be captured. Arthur had to keep his abilities a secret to avoid being discovered. One day, Arthur stumbled upon a wounded unicorn in the forest. Using his magic, he healed the unicorn and they became best friends. The unicorn told Arthur about an evil sorcerer who was planning to take over the kingdom. Arthur knew he had to stop him. With the help of the unicorn and other magical creatures, Arthur set out to defeat the sorcerer. After a long and dangerous journey, they finally reached the sorcerer's lair. A battle ensued, and just when it seemed like the sorcerer was going to win, Arthur used a powerful spell to defeat him. The kingdom was saved, and Arthur was hailed as a hero. However, he chose to keep his abilities a secret and returned to his quiet life in the forest, always cherishing the adventure that made him a true wizard.\n",

The chatbot platform, which offers customizable AI companions with distinct personalities and tools to make your own, is now offering a group chat experience where users and their friends can chat with multiple AI characters at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Character Group Chat feature, as it’s called, allows users to create a group chat with their favorite AI characters only or it can feature a mix of both humans and AI companions, the company says. The idea is that users will be able to create social connections with friends, or share ideas and collaborate in real-time, as in any other group chat experience, but with their AI companions now in the mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company suggests users could try out having AI scientists and thinkers chat together, like  Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Nikola Tesla, and Stephen Hawking, for example, or create a group chat with mythological gods like Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more practical use cases, you might start a group chat with friends around a topic or theme — like travel, gaming, book clubs, or role-playing — then invite an AI companion to help facilitate and augment those conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of adding AI chatbots into a group chat is not unique to Character.AI. Snapchat’s My AI chatbot can be added into group chats with the command @myai, while Meta recently introduced the ability to call up a host of new AI-powered bots across its apps, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram’s DMs, including those that are based on celebrities like Mr. Beast, Paris Hilton, Tom Brady, Charli D’Amelio, Snoop Dog, and others. The latter announcement, made at Meta’s Connect conference in late September, was a potential threat to Character.AI which raised a whopping $150 million in Series A funding earlier this year for its concepts around AI companions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Character.AI’s new group chat experience won’t be offered for free. Instead, the feature is first being made available to the c.ai+ subscribers in order to gain feedback and make improvements. C.ai+ is the startup’s $9.99 per month subscription plan that offers the ability to skip waiting rooms and access to faster message generation as well as an exclusive community channel for feedback and support, among other things. The company says it will later open up to feature to the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "At launch, Character Group Chat is also only available on the Character.AI mobile app on iOS and Android but will later roll out to the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company’s app initially topped half a million installs in its first six days and is said to be catching up with ChatGPT in the U.S. Third-party data from market intelligence provider data.ai indicates the app has close to 30 million monthly active users globally, and around 7 million in the U.S. The firm also estimates its lifetime gross in-app purchase revenue is $1.3 million, but c.ai+ is sold on the web so this is not a comprehensive look at its overall revenue.\"\"\"\n",

From self-driving cars to virtual personal assistants, AI is making significant advancements that promise to improve efficiency and productivity. However, as AI technology continues to evolve, it also raises concerns about its impact on the labor market.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has the potential to automate various tasks and processes, leading to increased efficiency and reduced labor costs for businesses. For example, in the manufacturing sector, robots and AI-powered machines can perform repetitive and physically demanding tasks more accurately and tirelessly than human workers. This reduces the need for manual labor and can lead to cost savings for companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the service industry, virtual assistants and chatbots are increasingly replacing human customer service representatives. These AI systems can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and even process orders 24/7, eliminating the need for a large workforce. This automation can improve response times and reduce operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the financial sector, AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to make investment decisions, manage portfolios, and detect fraudulent activities. This not only enhances the accuracy of financial operations but also reduces the need for human financial analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the increasing automation of jobs through AI can also lead to job displacement and concerns about unemployment. While some argue that AI will create new jobs in AI development and maintenance, there are valid worries about the workers who may not have the skills or resources to transition into these new roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these concerns, governments and organizations must invest in workforce development and retraining programs to help workers acquire the skills necessary for the jobs of the future. Additionally, there is a growing movement to establish universal basic income (UBI) programs to provide financial support to individuals who lose their jobs due to AI and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, AI also presents new opportunities for innovation and growth. As AI continues to advance, it opens up new avenues for businesses to develop novel products and services. For example, AI-powered healthcare applications can improve patient care and diagnostics. AI-driven transportation systems can enhance the safety and efficiency of travel.\n",

While it brings the promise of increased efficiency and reduced costs for businesses, it also poses challenges related to job displacement.

    "article6=\"\"\"Gaza, despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world, has ironically always been a tech hub — not only for Palestine and Palestinians, but for the world: international companies have, for many years, sought out a presence there to collaborate both with with talented tech freelancers, and the startups which gradually emerged from the region. For examples, according to sources who helped build those bridges, Nvidia, famed for it’s role in the new AI boom, has been working with at least 100 engineers from the region for years.\n",
    "Since at least 2008 TechCrunch been covering technology companies out of Palestine, some serving their direct audience, some serving the tech world internationally. Silicon Valley had taken an increasing interest in Palestine as a tech hub, but like the ecosystem itself, it’s nascent: to date, those working in the region estimate that much as $10 million has been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem.\n",
    "Notably, in 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff joined Silicon Valley luminaries in backing the first ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.\n",
    "Gaza Sky Geeks, an Alphabet-backed initiative based in Gaza that provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine’s Gazan population, has been a beacon of entrepreneurship in the region.\n",
    "All of that is now, effectively, gone, like the buildings in Gaza itself.\n",
    "Israel is currently retaliating militarily against the attacks on its people, on its soil, and the hostages subsequently taken by Hamas — the ruling organisation in Gaza that kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during brutal attacks on Israel at the weekend that killed 1,300 people.\n",
    "That strategy has seen it pummelling the ‘Gaza Strip’ with bombs to eradicate it of Hamas and to get its hostages back. Over 1,500 people in Palestine so far have been killed as a result. The tech industry in Israel — the country’s biggest export, and its biggest single contributor to GDP — is also taking a big knock (read about that here), but the impact on the smaller and more fragile ecosystem in Gaza has been, inevitably, significantly more serious. The physical, economic and societal destruction resulting from that leaves any future for the tech industry there in doubt.\n",
    "Quite simply, there is no escaping the consequences of the war for anyone, let alone tech workers.\n",
    "“What is happening to tech in Gaza is that Israel is crunching it. Obliterating it,” one source, inside the territory, told TechCrunch.\n",
    "Israel has now amassed soldiers near the north of Gaza, ahead of an expected ground offensive into the densely populated enclave. About 1.1 million people living in northern areas have been told to leave in the next day. The UN has warned of “devastating humanitarian consequences” from these latest moves. A total blockade on the territory is being enforced with fuel, food and water running out. Israel says it won’t lift the restrictions unless Hamas frees all hostages.\n",
    "Speaking to Ryan Sturgill, an American national and former head of the Gaza Sky Geeks accelerator run by sponsor Mercy Corps, and NGO aid organisation, the situation on the ground appears dire, after waves of shelling by the Israeli military.\n",
    "“The area around the the Mercy Corps building, which housed Gaza Sky Geeks, has been levelled. The structure is standing but blown out. The front of it is sort of ripped off,” he said.\n",
    "Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG) is the largest tech-hub in Palestine, providing a wide range of tech training at scale. In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the programme.\n",
    "Video evidence (pictured above) posted on Linkedin shows a blown-out building with the Mercy Corps sign.\n",
    "“Who knows what’s going to happen. The offices are destroyed, the fibre lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed. Three main universities in Gaza that produce all the computer science grads are levelled. I don’t even know if people will be ever be able to go back to Northern Gaza after what’s happening today.The educational institutions that are there are gone,” Sturgill added.\n",
    "He had been helping Palestinian tech startups raise capital in the West Bank and Gaza since January.\n",
    "“Until now, there had been a pretty significant growth. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia have been setting up back offices [in Palestine] for development for all sorts of new companies and even apps that are that are now growing in the Gulf, because Saudi has been growing so quickly on the tech front. Nvidia, and other international companies, has outsourcing operations in Palestine. Apple has outsourcing operations, Microsoft has R&D, and they would even like to see those expand. There’s companies that had 200 developers sitting in offices in Ramallah,” he said.\n",
    "“I’ve talked to all of the heads of these different offices, most of them are in in Israel. They are very positive people who want to try to support the tech industry there and those efforts have been working well and growing,” he added.\n",
    "Indeed, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, Ibtikar, had recently raised its second fund of $30 million.\n",
    "High growth companies emerging from Palestine include Menalytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat 6 labs); Olivery (last mile logistics, Flat6Labs and Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and Sellenvo (an Amazon fulfillment partner).\n",
    "Sturgill said that as well as the intensely difficult conditions in Gaza, which is being hit by Israeli missiles, the situation in Ramallah is “super tense. I feel like the situation is going to get significantly worse there over the coming weeks.”\n",
    "Iliana Montauk, is co-Founder and CEO of Manara — a social impact startup funded by Y Combinator, Seedcamp, Reid Hoffman, Eric Ries, Marc Benioff, Paul Graham, and Jessica Livingston, among others — told Techcrunch via email that connectivity has decreased significantly in the past 24 hours.\n",
    "“Though Gaza has been bombed many times before, this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons. Electricity was cut off to the entire [Gaza] strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighborhoods are being destroyed.”\n",
    "She said in the past if an entire neighborhood got destroyed, it was usually one bordering Israel and a poorer area, thus less impacting the tech sector.\n",
    "“The tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,” she said. “Most people are in too much danger to be able to work; some have evacuated three times in the past 24 hours, moving from friend’s house to family house, because each neighborhood they end up in is the next one being bombed. They usually receive warnings to evacuate their homes 10 minutes before a bombing, so they don’t sleep and monitor the situation constantly ready to evacuate in a minute’s notice.”\n",
    "“Most people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones.. Electricity is no longer being provided even for a few hours a day now, and people are running out of gas for their generators,” she added.\n",
    "Manara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley/Europe.\n",
    "Montauk said one software engineer who works at Upwork disappeared for several days, until being found alive.\n",
    "Dalia Awad, whose Medium post about getting into Google from Gaza went viral in 2021 (it was at one point #1 on Hacker News and tweeted by Paul Graham), returned to Gaza after her internships at Google and Datadog to graduate from university. She had a full-time job offer at Datadog in Paris but decided to stay home in Gaza and look for a remote job so she could be close to family.\n",
    "On Tuesday she wrote to Montauk saying: “Tonight was the worst night ever. My family and I are good, thankfully. The bombing was everywhere and we couldn’t know where it was because there was no internet. Many of my friends lost their houses in the Rimal area.. There is no wifi internet, we connect to the cellular data on our phones but it’s only 2G and it connects for a few minutes then cuts off. We can only send Whatsapp messages. So we can’t really read news on social media. In the morning we saw these videos from our friends who shared it on whatsapp but it takes FOREVER to download a video of a few seconds.”\n",
    "Montauk said Awad had not responded to her in the past day.\n",
    "Mai Temraz, Manara’s first employee, is based in San Bernardino, California. Her family live in Gaza City. They narrowly escaped a bombing (she posted [Content warning] a video on Instagram of them bleeding). She said: “My family barely survived an attack on a building next to them in Gaza. They ask people to leave, WHERE?? No one is save [sic.] anywhere in Gaza.”\n",
    "Montauk, a former director of Gaza Gaza Sky Geeks, said: “Before this escalation, the Gaza tech scene was growing. I was just in Riyadh and met companies that hire entire software development teams in Gaza. Upwork and other Silicon Valley companies are now hiring software engineers remotely from Gaza. In addition, some had left to work abroad at companies like Google, Amazon, Qualtrics, etc. Last time I was in Gaza a year ago, almost everyone I talked to asked me how they could get a job and leave Gaza. They were worried about more bombings and wanted to bring their children up in a place without such a high risk. These people just want to live normal lives.”\n",
    "Those who are living in the West Bank say the activity in Gaza has had an inevitable impact.\n",
    "“For a Palestinian young woman like me living in the West Bank, I can confirm that there has been a noticeable freeze in terms of activity,” said Leen Abubaker of Flow Accelerator and Cofounder at Sawaed19. “Tech companies are either operating on a very limited scale, with employees struggling to reach their offices in the West Bank due to unsafe roads blocked by Israeli occupation forces and settlers, or they have been forced out of business entirely in Gaza.”\n",
    "She added that a number of building in Gaza key to the tech industry there, such as Burj Al-Wattan, had been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and that the tech industry is not the first priority people in the urgent situation. “How can you possibly detach from the distressing reality and cling to the remaining shreds of hope for your business?”\n",
    "Mohammad Alnobani is a Palestinian founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools, aiming to shatter stereotypes about the Arab world through images and reducing bias in AI.\n",
    "He told me he was on his way back from the One Young World Summit in Belfast, speaking about peace and reconciliation, and about to reach the borders to cross to Palestine to get back to his family, when the war broke out.\n",
    "“The borders closed down and I had to turn around and go back to Jordan,” he said. “I am still there, continuously checking on my family in Jerusalem, and trying to reach out to my connections in Gaza.” His co-founder, Raya Fatayer, is in Ramallah, staying at home with her baby and husband, not able to travel.\n",
    "“Our fellow entrepreneurs in Gaza had their homes demolished by air strikes, some we can’t even reach anymore since the electricity is out and they have no power,” he said. “Dealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.”\n",
    "He said this outbreak of hosilities with Israel is clearly different: “Before, every time Gaza faced air strikes, we knew that certain areas were almost safe. Clearly today, nobody is safe.”\n",

    "In recent years, the effects of the digital divide have become increasingly apparent. As more and more essential services move online, people without internet access find it harder to participate in the modern economy. In response, many governments are considering subsidizing internet access. The idea is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their income or where they live, can access the digital world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents argue that subsidized internet access can have multiple benefits. Firstly, it can lead to increased economic activity. As people gain access to online services, they can participate in e-commerce, take online courses, and apply for jobs online. Furthermore, it can help bridge the educational gap. Students in areas with poor or no internet access often lag behind their peers in terms of academic achievement. Having consistent internet access can help these students catch up.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, critics of subsidized internet access point out potential drawbacks. The cost of implementing such programs can be high, and it's not clear whether the benefits would outweigh the costs. There's also concern about whether the subsidies would lead to a dependence on government support. Instead, some suggest that market solutions, like competition among internet service providers, might be a more effective way to bring down costs and increase access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the idea of subsidized internet access is well-intentioned, it's crucial to carefully weigh its potential benefits and drawbacks. The goal should be to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at participating in the digital age, but how best to achieve that is up for debate.\n",

The urgency to combat climate change and the economic advantages of renewable sources have both played pivotal roles in this transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar energy, in particular, has seen a meteoric rise. With advancements in solar panel efficiency and decreases in manufacturing costs, countries around the world are rapidly installing solar farms. The Sahara Desert, with its vast expanses of sunlight, has often been cited as an ideal location for solar energy capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind energy isn't far behind. Coastal areas and open plains have become hotspots for wind farms, taking advantage of persistent wind patterns. Innovations in turbine design have also allowed for more efficient energy capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydroelectric power, while not new, has gained renewed attention. Dams are not just about water storage anymore; they're powerhouses, quite literally. However, they've also been at the center of environmental and displacement debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the advantages of renewable energy are many, there are challenges. Storage is a significant issue. The sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. This intermittency means that there needs to be efficient ways to store energy for off-peak times. Battery technology, therefore, is a field seeing massive investment and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is infrastructure. Many of our current grids are not designed to handle the influx of renewable energy, and there's a dire need to upgrade them. This requires not just funds, but also policy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, while renewable energy is more sustainable, there are environmental concerns. Wind farms can affect local fauna, and the manufacture of solar panels isn't without its carbon footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the shift to renewable energy is promising and necessary, it's not a silver bullet. The challenges need addressing with the same fervor as the adoption of the energy sources themselves.\n",

I feel like the situation is going to get significantly worse there over the coming weeks.”\\nIliana Montauk, is co-Founder and CEO of Manara — a social impact startup funded by Y Combinator, Seedcamp, Reid Hoffman, Eric Ries, Marc Benioff, Paul Graham, and Jessica Livingston, among others — told Techcrunch via email that connectivity has decreased significantly in the past 24 hours. Dalia Awad, whose Medium post about getting into Google from Gaza went viral in 2021 (it was at one point #1 on Hacker News and tweeted by Paul Graham), returned to Gaza after her internships at Google and Datadog to graduate from university. In the morning we saw these videos from our friends who shared it on whatsapp but it takes FOREVER to download a video of a few seconds.”\\nMontauk said Awad had not responded to her in the past day. “Tech companies are either operating on a very limited scale, with employees struggling to reach their offices in the West Bank due to unsafe roads blocked by Israeli occupation forces and settlers, or they have been forced out of business entirely in Gaza.”\\nShe added that a number of building in Gaza key to the tech industry there, such as Burj Al-Wattan, had been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and that the tech industry is not the first priority people in the urgent situation.'"

She wasn't like the villagers who lived on the outskirts of the forest; she could communicate with the creatures of the woods and understand the songs of the trees. One day, as Elara was strolling through the forest, she stumbled upon a wounded unicorn. Its horn was broken, and it lay in pain. Without hesitation, Elara approached the magnificent creature, whispering soothing words and using herbs to heal its wounds. In gratitude, the unicorn revealed its secret: it was the guardian of a magical portal that led to another realm. However, the portal had been sealed by dark forces, and the unicorn's horn was the key to unlocking it. But with its horn broken, the path to the other realm was lost. Determined to help, Elara set out on a quest to find a way to mend the unicorn's horn and reopen the portal. Her journey took her to the mountains where she met a wise old dragon, to the depths of the oceans where she befriended mermaids, and to the skies where she danced with the stars. Each encounter taught her a valuable lesson and brought her closer to her goal. After many adventures and challenges, Elara finally discovered a way to restore the unicorn's horn using the power of pure love. With the portal reopened, the realms were once again connected, and peace was restored. Elara returned to the Whispering Woods, not just as a friend of the forest, but as its savior. The trees sang her praises, and the creatures celebrated her bravery. And so, in the heart of the forest, the legend of Elara, the guardian of the realms, was born.\"\"\"\n",

At the heart of the town stood the Elderton Mansion, a grand old house that was said to be haunted. Built in the 1800s by Sir Reginald Elderton, the mansion had been the site of numerous inexplicable occurrences, from ghostly apparitions to strange noises in the dead of night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Reginald had been a renowned explorer, traveling to the farthest corners of the world in search of ancient artifacts and hidden treasures. On one fateful expedition to the Amazon rainforest, it was said that he had found a mysterious artifact, a golden amulet with the power to bridge the world of the living and the dead. When he returned to Elderton, he was a changed man. Obsessed with the amulet's power, he locked himself in the mansion, conducting strange rituals and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One stormy night, a loud explosion echoed from the mansion, and Sir Reginald was never seen again. The amulet, too, vanished, fueling rumors that it had claimed him. The mansion was locked up, and as years turned into decades, it fell into disrepair. Yet, locals reported seeing lights in the mansion's windows and hearing Sir Reginald's voice on stormy nights.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside, the air was thick with dust and age. Clara's flashlight beam cut through the darkness, revealing ornate furniture covered in dust cloths, and walls adorned with faded portraits of the Elderton lineage. As she explored, she stumbled upon Sir Reginald's study, a room filled with books, maps, and a journal detailing his obsession with the amulet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As midnight approached, Clara began to hear whispers. Following the sound, she came to a grand ballroom, where a ghostly figure danced alone. It was Sir Reginald. He spoke to Clara, revealing that he had been trapped in a limbo between worlds by the amulet's power. He had been trying to harness its energy to communicate with his deceased wife, but instead, it had ensnared him. He implored Clara to find the amulet and free him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using clues from Sir Reginald's journal, Clara embarked on a quest that took her to hidden chambers and secret passages within the mansion. Finally, in the mansion's depths, she found the amulet, glowing with an otherworldly light. Remembering the rituals detailed in the journal, Clara performed a ceremony to break the amulet's curse.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sure, they’re neat tricks, but they’re also useful, rather than being features for features’ sake. Moving forward, however, the real trick will be seamlessly integrating them into the experience. With ideal future workflows, most users will have little to no notion of what’s happening behind the scenes. They’ll just be happy that it works. It’s the classic Apple playbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI offers a similar “wow” effect out the gate, which is another way it differs from its hype cycle predecessor. When your least tech savvy relative can sit at a computer, type a few words into a dialogue field and then watch as the black box spits out paintings and short stories, there isn’t much conceptualizing required. That’s a big part of the reason all of this caught on as quickly as it did — most times when everyday people get pitched cutting-edge technologies, it requires them to visualize how it might look five or 10 years down the road.\n",

    "With ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc., you can experience it firsthand right now. Of course, the flip side of this is how difficult it becomes to temper expectations. Much as people are inclined to imbue robots with human or animal intelligence, without a fundamental understanding of AI, it’s easy to project intentionality here. But that’s just how things go now.

It’s giving me 70%. There are obvious things you can already see that are definitely a step function better than how things were before. Summarizing something’s not perfect. I’m not going to let it read and summarize for me. So, you can already see some signs of productivity improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, during my last conversation with Daniela Rus, the MIT CSAIL head explained how researchers are using generative AI to actually design the robots:\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that generative AI can be quite powerful for solving even motion planning problems. You can get much faster solutions and much more fluid and human-like solutions for control than with model predictive solutions. I think that’s very powerful, because the robots of the future will be much less roboticized. They will be much more fluid and human-like in their motions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve also used generative AI for design. This is very powerful. It’s also very interesting , because it’s not just pattern generation for robots. You have to do something else. It can’t just be generating a pattern based on data. The machines have to make sense in the context of physics and the physical world. For that reason, we connect them to a physics-based simulation engine to make sure the designs meet their required constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, a team at Northwestern University unveiled its own research into AI-generated robot design. The researchers showcased how they designed a “successfully walking robot in mere seconds.” It’s not much to look at, as these things go, but it’s easy enough to see how with additional research, the approach could be used to create more complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We discovered a very fast AI-driven design algorithm that bypasses the traffic jams of evolution, without falling back on the bias of human designers,” said research lead Sam Kriegman. “We told the AI that we wanted a robot that could walk across land. Then we simply pressed a button and presto! It generated a blueprint for a robot in the blink of an eye that looks nothing like any animal that has ever walked the earth. I call this process ‘instant evolution.’”\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the AI program’s choice to put legs on the small, squishy robot. “It’s interesting because we didn’t tell the AI that a robot should have legs,” Kriegman added. “It rediscovered that legs are a good way to move around on land. Legged locomotion is, in fact, the most efficient form of terrestrial movement.”\n",

    "“From my perspective, generative AI and physical automation/robotics are what’s going to change everything we know about life on Earth,” Formant founder and CEO Jeff Linnell told me this week. “I think we’re all hip to the fact that AI is a thing and are expecting every one our jobs, every company and student will be impacted. I think it’s symbiotic with robotics. You’re not going to have to program a robot. You’re going to speak to the robot in English, request an action and then it will be figured out. It’s going to be a minute for that.”\n",

       "'Generative AI offers a similar “wow” effect out the gate, which is another way it differs from its hype cycle predecessor. Last week, when I asked Nvidia’s VP and GM of Embedded and Edge Computing, Deepu Talla why the company believes generative AI is more than a fad, he told me:\\n\\nI think it speaks in the results. Things are, however, different with generative AI. Meanwhile, during my last conversation with Daniela Rus, the MIT CSAIL head explained how researchers are using generative AI to actually design the robots:\\n\\nIt turns out that generative AI can be quite powerful for solving even motion planning problems. It’s not exactly right, but I don’t have to start from zero. We’ve taught 60 different skills so far.\\n\\n I admit that I was a bit hesitant to spend more time on the subject a few months back. There have been great advances on that front in recent years, and I think many manufacturers have finally struck a good balance between hardware and software when it comes to both improving the end product and lowering the bar of entry. The researchers showcased how they designed a “successfully walking robot in mere seconds.” For example, in my recent conversation with Marc Raibert and Gill Pratt, the latter explained the role generative AI is playing in its approach to robot learning:\\n\\nWe have figure out how to do something, which is use modern generative AI techniques that enable human demonstration of both position and force to essentially teach a robot from just a handful of examples. It generated a blueprint for a robot in the blink of an eye that looks nothing like any animal that has ever walked the earth. “From my perspective, generative AI and physical automation/robotics are what’s going to change everything we know about life on Earth,” Formant founder and CEO Jeff Linnell told me this week. That’s a big part of the reason all of this caught on as quickly as it did — most times when everyday people get pitched cutting-edge technologies, it requires them to visualize how it might look five or 10 years down the road.\\n\\n Spoiler alert: Nine times out of 10 they won’t, and suddenly we’re spending months and years attempting to walk things back to reality.\\n\\n'"

    "Executive Summary:\n",
    "The ongoing effects of climate change present significant challenges to global agriculture. This report delves into the repercussions of rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events on agricultural productivity and food security.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction:\n",
    "Climate change, characterized by global warming, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events, has become one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century. Agriculture, being highly dependent on climatic conditions, stands vulnerable to these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature Rise: A consistent increase in temperatures affects crop germination and growth. While certain crops may benefit from a slight temperature rise, most will suffer, especially if the increase surpasses their optimal growth temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precipitation Patterns: Changes in rainfall patterns can lead to prolonged droughts or excessive rainfall. Both scenarios are detrimental to crops, impacting yield and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme Weather Events: The rising frequency of hurricanes, floods, and droughts can devastate crops, leading to food shortages and market instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift in Agricultural Zones: As temperatures rise, traditional agricultural zones are shifting. This forces farmers to adapt by either changing their cropping patterns or relocating their farming operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Economic Implications:\n",
    "The agricultural sector, contributing significantly to the GDP of many nations, faces economic strain due to reduced yields. This leads to increased food prices, affecting consumers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Social Impact:\n",
    "Food security is compromised, especially in developing nations. This can lead to malnutrition, societal unrest, and even mass migrations in search of better livelihood opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Potential Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Farming Techniques: Introduction of drought-resistant crops, efficient irrigation systems, and soil conservation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Warning Systems: Implementation of meteorological tools to forecast extreme weather events, allowing farmers to take preventive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governmental Support: Policy interventions, subsidies, and support in research and development to drive innovations in farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conclusion:\n",
    "While the challenges posed by climate change are daunting, with collective effort, technology, and adaptive strategies, the global agricultural community can navigate these uncharted waters. Continuous research, investment, and awareness are crucial.\"\"\",1,'report')"

    "Solar energy, in particular, has seen exponential growth. The cost of solar panels has plummeted, making it more accessible to homeowners and businesses. Innovative grid-tied systems allow excess energy to be sold back to the grid, creating an incentive for adoption. The efficiency of photovoltaic cells continues to improve, further driving the appeal of solar energy.\n",

    "Hydropower, using the energy of flowing water to generate electricity, is not a new concept. However, recent technological innovations have revitalized this age-old method. New turbine designs, which are more fish-friendly and efficient, are being implemented in dams across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not just about technology. Governments and corporations are recognizing the value of renewable energy. Investments in green technologies are surging, and international agreements like the Paris Accord emphasize the global commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\n",

However, the report highlights the interest in AI apps among this portion of the Mac user base, noting that top AI apps included those that aren’t only native to macOS — like Google’s AI Bard and Bing, which integrated AI technology from OpenAI. In addition, other top AI apps users mentioned using include TypingMind, Elephas, Spark, Notion, Grammarly, Craft, Luminar Neo, MacGPT, Asana, Raycast and MacWhisper. Some of these leverage AI to augment their existing apps, as opposed to being an app that’s solely focused on interacting with AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We see how AI is transforming the app’s usage experience by providing additional user assistance,” said Mykola Savin, product lead of Setapp, in an announcement. “At Setapp, we also witness a great adoption of AI tools and the features we implement on the platform. Maybe not everyone succeeds with AI on the first try. But when they do, they tend to use those features repeatedly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first year Setapp has asked in its annual survey about AI app adoption, so it’s not possible to quantify how many more Mac users are now using AI apps daily, compared with years past. But AI apps’ slice of users’ daily workflows is significant, it seems. Out of an average of 51 installed apps on their Mac, users access up to 15 daily. And as 42% say they’re using AI apps daily, that means AI is now a large part of users’ daily workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other often-used apps include browser apps, Microsoft and Google Office tools (both of which are integrating AI technologies, as well), and Adobe software — the latter which has embraced generative AI across a range of apps, including Photoshop, and other Creative Cloud apps. So users’ true exposure to AI-powered apps may be even higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey also reports on other general findings about Mac app adoption and discovery, noting that subscriptions are more popular than one-time purchases, and the top means of app discovery include the Mac App store, YouTube and social media. In addition, 70% of the survey respondents report having a Mac with either an M1 or M2 chip, among other highlights. \"\"\",\n",

    "dynamic_detailed_summarize_premium(\"\"\"The Sam Bankman-Fried trial gained steam after a somewhat sleepier first half of the day. That’s when prosecutors and the defense asked a witness and former FTX developer about the technical details of the crypto exchange as well as Alameda Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that changed around 4 p.m. when FTX co-founder and CTO Gary Wang took the stand, wearing a wrinkled suit. Prior to Wang taking the stand, there was a 15-minute break during which Bankman-Fried looked visibly irritated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bankman-Fried’s parents were also there. During the break, they went to their son seemingly in an effort to provide support. At one point his father, Joseph Bankman, patted his mother, Barbara Fried, on the back, said something and laughed. She didn’t laugh back but continued to look away toward her son.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the stand, Wang admitted that he committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud. He added that Bankman-Fried, Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison were the individuals he committed the crimes with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wang, Singh and Ellison pleaded guilty in late December 2022 as part of a deal to cooperate with the government and testify during this trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wang said that they were given “special privileges from Alameda Research,” the crypto trading firm that he said he and Bankman-Fried started prior to launching FTX. Those privileges included getting large lines of credit, unlimited withdrawals and being able to have negative balances. Wang said that the “unlimited funds” came from FTX customers; a special code was added to customer transactions that funneled the money to Alameda.\n",
    "\n",
    "He shared during his testimony that he was in charge of writing and reviewing code. And while Bankman-Fried did not write the code, Wang said Bankman-Fried did tell him and other developers what to implement. “Sometimes we talked [disagreements] out, but in the end, it’s Sam’s decision,” Wang said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative balances, unlimited withdrawals\n",
    "Because of these special privileges, Alameda had a $65 billion line of credit, Wang said. “Normal large businesses have single to double digits [of credit] in the millions.” By the time the two businesses filed for bankruptcy in mid November 2022, Alameda withdrew $8 billion, Wang said.\n",
    "\n",
    "These internal financial advantages were not disclosed to the public, he shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alameda and FTX were both started by Bankman-Fried and Wang, with ownership split 90% and 10%, and then 17% equity and 65% equity, respectively. Singh also had 5% equity of FTX, and a number of outside investors held other positions, Wang noted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ownership percentages never changed, he added. At the time, both Wang and Bankman-Fried were billionaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "During his time at the companies, Wang also disclosed that Alameda “loaned” him around $200 million to $300 million. But the money never went to his bank account, and it instead went to investments that FTX made into other companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming the business\n",
    "The company also picked its name to outsmart other businesses, which might have negative connotations toward companies with crypto jargon in their titles. “Alameda” derived from Alameda County in California and “Research,” was because it “sounds prestigious” and is not using a crypto-related name, Wang said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial funds for Alameda came from Bankman-Fried personally as well as various lenders. Wang said Bankman-Fried also believed it would be easier to get bank accounts, rental leases, investors and so on, with a more “normal” company name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prosecutors aired a clip of Bankman-Fried from April 2021 on a podcast, where he explained Alameda’s name. “If we named our company Shitcoin Day Trader’s Inc., no one would do business [with us],” he said at the time.\n",
    "\n",
